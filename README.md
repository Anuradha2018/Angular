MODULES
The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components.
an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators
The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view.
The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through dependency injection (DI).<br>
